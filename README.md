# PriceWar
Compare prices on various products over time

todo:
add logging framework, possible separate logfile with date for each execution
setup on server for execution each day or maybe week (in order not to get banned)
work on the presentation layer... Maybe have interface to specify your own sql and ordering.
 - add column: how much in percent did the item decreese/increese in price <-- interesting...
Have html files for each category for easy accessery
